# LithiumBatteryEmulator

This is a PCB that emulates a ~4.2 volt lithium battery cell using power from
a USB connector.  It was designed to replace the battery cell in a Vocera badge
with a wall supplied power supply, but may be useful for other project too.

The board is designed to meet the Seeed studios fusion PCB assembly
requirements, including using the Seeed studio Open Part Library for
KiCad.
